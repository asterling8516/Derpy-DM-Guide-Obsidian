Here are some links to resources I use for world building, creature creation, and just other resources.

# The Home Brewery
#### Uses
I use the [homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/) to create "official" looking documents for my D&D campaigns. In fact that was how I made the Wild Magic Surge Tables

# Dunjon
#### Uses
The [Dunjon website](https://donjon.bin.sh/) is great for helping create dungeons, shops, loot tables and so much more! It has been a great boon for inspiration and world creation!

# Kobold Press
#### Uses
The [Kobold Press]([https://koboldpress.com/kpstore?raf=ref4237525](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore?raf=ref4237525)) has many great resources from monsters and how to run shopping to assets for your favorite VTT.
