### Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall [[Unconscious]], as explained in the following sections.  
  

#### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.  
  
For example, a Cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.  
  

#### Falling Unconscious

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall [[Unconscious]]. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.  
  

#### Death Saving Throws

Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any [[Ability Score]]s. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by **spells** and **features** that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.  
  
**Roll a d20**: If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become [stable](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_57) (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.  
  
**Rolling 1 or 20**: When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.  
  
**Damage at 0 Hit Points**: If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a [critical hit](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_49), you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.
