Welcome fellow adventurers, to **The Derpy Dm's Guide**!

Pull up a chair and bring your dice! In this realm we believe in the **The Rule of Cool** and everyone's fun comes first. The raw mechanics are important, but sometimes need bent to make that cinematic moment for my players. 

This is compilation of information for my players to access that I can add information to for them to access later. I hope that some of the information found within can help those on their own grand adventure! Thank you for visiting our tavern make sure to tip your bartender! 

Last thing I do use AI to generate images as this is a solo endeavor, commissioning all the artwork needed for such an ambitious project would cost a dragons hoard. The images are made to give my players a more clear vision of who or what they are interacting with and added for that purpose. 

So, grab your sword, ready your spells, and prepare your most charming (or terrifying) character voice. Your adventure starts now!
