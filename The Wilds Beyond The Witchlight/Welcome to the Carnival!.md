Once every seven years The Witchlight Carnival visits and it just so happens that now is that time! When you were younger you snuck into the carnival without paying for your ticket, but were caught by the hosts of the carnival Mr. Witch and Mr. Light. They warned you that you would still have to pay the price for the ticket even though it may not be what you expect the cost to be. 

You each have had something taken from you. Your sense of fashion, your sense of direction etc. You and a few others seem to have been drawn back to this place in search of whatever was taken and feel that these other people have lost something just like you did. A kinship formed you head into the carnival to retrieve these. What awaits you? Who will you meet? Who will you become? Only time will tell as we venture into carnival!
