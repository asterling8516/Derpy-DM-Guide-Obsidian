Last time on The Wilds Beyond The Witchlight. We learned that you had all lost something long ago a small children having been caught by Mr. Witch and Mr. Light  and warned that everything has a cost that cost would be paid. Now feeling the pull of your lost things by the Witchlight Carnival you have once again returned.

B - Losing her sense of fashion. 
Jayquelin - Losing her ability to keep secrets
Raven - Losing her sense of direction
Vania - Losing her handwriting ability
Nox - Having lost an important stuffed animal 

In place of these missing things you all found you had been cursed in one form or another. 

B, Raven, and Nox - Unable to tie or until knots 
Jayquelin - Unable to light non magical fires
Vania - Cant fight the urge to knock before opening a door

Upon your arrival at the carnival you felt this pull of few others whom you knew instinctively also were missing something, and heading into the carnival. Stealing crowns from children. Riding in bubbles from a tea pot and playing games and a few of you chose to fight with the staff stabbing one of them and punching another then threatening more as them came to escort you out. Ultimately your decisions seem to have impacted the carnival causing the lights to dim and the music to grow quieter and slower until the carnival was shut down. 

You then left and came back the next day apologizing to the crew to get back in and they ultimately relented on the second night of the carnival allowing you back in. Where you partook in a pie eating contest, tried your luck with a few more games, rode the carousel, raced one the backs of giant snails, and learned of your nightmares in the mystery mine. Nox and Jayquelin were able to save a small child who had mishap at the dragonfly ride causing the atmosphere to grow more euphoric. 

The carnival is in full swing now as more people have shown up, the night sky has moved in turning the carnivals lights into twinkling starts.
