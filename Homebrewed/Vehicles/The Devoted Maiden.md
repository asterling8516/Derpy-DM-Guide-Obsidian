# Action
On its turn The Devoted Maiden may take 4 actions if it has 40 or more crew reducing the number of actions by 1 every 10 deaths of crew members with a minimum of 1 action at 10 or less crew. Choosing from the options below:
**Fire Ballista's:** The Devoted Maiden can fire its harpoon guns (1) or fire its cannons (3). (costs the ship one action to reload after firing)
**Move.** The Devoted Maiden can use its helm to move using its propeller. If The Devoted Maiden enters a Large or smaller creature's space, that creature is automatically pushed to the edge of The Devoted Maiden's space. The creature must also succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take (3d10) bludgeoning damage.
**Harpoon Haul.** The Devoted Maiden can pull each target grappled by it up to 30 feet toward the hull. If the creature is smaller than the ship there is no save if the creature is the same size or larger it must succeed on a strength save. 

# The Hull
**Armor Class** 16
**Hit Points** 475 (damage threshold 20)

# The Helm
**Armor Class** 18
**Hit Points** 50

**Movement** up to 200ft per round. To be able to continue steering the ship must move at least 50ft that turn. If it drops below this is the ship becomes Immobilized and begins drifting. 
**Drop The Anchor** You drop one of the anchors making a 90 degree turn. Costs 40ft of movement and may only be done once per turn without consequences.

# The Sails
**Armor Class** 12
**Hit Points** 150

Speed is reduced by 10ft for every 50 damage taken to the sails 

# Weapon: Harpoon Gun (3) two at the front and one on the back of the ship
**Armor Class** 15
**Hit Points** 50 each

_Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d10) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until the grapple ends, the target's speed is halved, and it can't move farther away from The Devoted Maiden. Each of The Devoted Maiden's harpoon guns can grapple one target.

# Weapon: Fire Cannon (12) 6 per side
**Armor Class** 15
**Hit Points** 25 each

**Note:** The hull must be breached before the cannons can take damage. Though by then your probably sinking so good luck. 

_Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. _Hit:_  (4d10) piercing damage plus (8d6) fire damage with twice the damage to structures. Medium or smaller creatures make a Dex 15 save or be knocked prone.


# The Crew

#### Stats
| **STR** | **DEX** | **CON** | **INT** | **WIS** | **CHA** |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 14 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 12 (+1) | 10 (0)  | 10 (0)  | 10 (0)  |
**AC** 13 leather armor and shields
**HP** 523 (2d8 per crew member..ish) roughly every 10 points of damage taken is one death for the swarm
**Speed** 30

While the crews main duty is to man the ship they can instead take other actions such as:

**Attack** Musket Fire: *Ranged Attack* +4 to attack and does 2d10 piercing damage for each crew member making the attack
**Repair** Anything can happen on the seas and the crew is good at keeping everything ship shape. Gain a +3 on repairs made to their ship. Increases with each addition crew member
**Bale Water** Sometimes the worst happens and water leaks spring. This requires at least 5 members bailing water to keep the ship from sinking and 10 members to get a head of the leak and fix it.
