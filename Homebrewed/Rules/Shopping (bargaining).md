# Shopping
Introducing some new rules from [Kobold Press]([https://koboldpress.com/kpstore?raf=ref4237525](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore?raf=ref4237525))'s  Wander's Guide to Merchants and Magic and slighting changing them to fit my players and campaigns. We will use some new rules for shopping to hopefully make shopping more fun and providing more RP opportunities. 

# Setting the price
Roll 1d6 to set the starting price from the merchant. This will be based off the items actual value and adding a markup to the item for the merchant to make a profit (that is kind of the whole point in being a merchant)

# Appraisal 
Depending on the initial cost of the item (before the merchant adds a percentage for profit) you can do an appraisal check to figure out the rough cost of the item. Roll 1d20 + History/Arcana. The higher the cost of the item the higher the DC will be.

# Initial Offer
The merchant tells you the starting price of the item. You can choose to purchase it outright from them at this price or you can counter offer

# Counter Offer
The character makes a counter off on the item. Then rolls a Charisma (Persuasion) check. **Beware**: offering a counter offer that is to low may result in insulting the merchant making the bargain more difficult. 

# New Offer
Depending on the roll the merchant may adjust the price of the item up or down. 

# Want to try your luck again?
Through RP/changing your offer/or something else. You can make another attempt at a bargain. There is a limit to how many times you can make this attempt though so be careful. 

# Impacts
There are a few things that will impact the starting cost such as
- Species (for example in our world [[Eureka]] the devils and the mortals may not have the best relationship due to [[The Treaty of Evermore | The Great War]] and may set the price higher to start)
- Class. An alchemist may set the price a bit lower for a fellow alchemist.
- Reputation. Are you a renowned adventurer? Do you come back to the same merchant often? Have you helped the merchant out before?
- Manners. Having a silver tongue when talking to someone you want to buy something from may not be a bad thing

**THESE RULES DO NOT APPLY TO THE SHOP OF MANY THINGS**
