You may drink a healing potion for a bonus action allowing you to get the maximum amount of hp back

You can throw a healing potion to an ally as a bonus action causing them to roll for regained HP. You can throw the health potion a minimum of 20ft adding 5ft for every modifier to strength. Example a Barbarian with +4 to strength could throw the potion 40ft

You can use a free action to drink a health potion and roll the dice regaining that amount of HP
