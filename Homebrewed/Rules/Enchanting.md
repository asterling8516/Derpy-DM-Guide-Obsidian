Using [Kobold Press's]([https://koboldpress.com/kpstore?raf=ref4237525](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore?raf=ref4237525)) Wanderers Guide to enchantments and adding in some twists of my own here are the rules for enchanting items. All of the rules below can be changed or adjusted at the DM's discretion. 

# Quick Bits
Enchanting can require any of the following in many variations.
- Money
- Time (Hours, Days, Weeks, etc.)
- Materials (Wing of bat, eye of newt, a stool of a toad)
- Spells (the casting of a spell during the creation of the item)
- Help (From an NPC or other PC)

Enchanting an item instead of buying a magic item may cost more, but this allows you to tailor items for scenarios though. Example used in the book is the wand of magic missile would typically cost around 1,500GP where enchanting the same wand would cost 5,000GP.

Items with charges will use charges from the same pool. So if a wand of magic missile has 7 charges and you enchant it with something else that uses charges like adding the daylight spell to an item to be castable would consume charges. Higher level spells may also require more charges to be used. 

Enchanting an item to be able to cast a certain spell will require someone (PC or NPC) to assist in the enchanting of the item. During the creation time they will need to cast the spell at least once daily.

You can take your time enchanting an item giving a bonus to the crafting of the item's DC when making it or you can be wreck less and take a penalty to the item's DC when crafting. This will affect the amount of time spent turning days to hours or hours to days. 

You can upgrade an enchantment later. Like with the Armor Bonus say you get a piece of armor with a +1 you can later upgrade that to a +2 then later again to a +3

# Magic Item Levels
Each enchantment adds to the items magic level thus making it harder to craft, requiring more components, spells, and time.

# Magical Properties
Magic Properties are effects that can be enchanted to provide the suer with bonuses: +1 to AC, bonus damage, Darkvision, etc. The more properties added the harder it will be to enchant. The "better" the property will also add to its difficulty example: enchanting an item with an Ability Bonus will be harder and cost more than add say Climbing to the same item.

Here is a list of magical properties:
## Key:
A - Requires attunement
R - Repeatable (Damage resistance could be repeated twice once for acid once for cold damage resistances)
M - Spellcasting properties
W - Weapon properties. Can only be enchanted on weapons
S - Saving throw properties. Require the wearer or another creature to make a saving throw
