# Prerequisites
You have spent some amount of time (as determined by the DM) within [[The Shifting Veil]].

## Description
The pervasive dust and forgotten energies of [[The Shifting Veil]] have begun to subtly alter your form, drawing you closer to the nature of its denizens. Your skin takes on a pallid, ashen complexion, and your may begin to fade to grey or white. Fine motes of dust cling to your clothes and skin, and your movements gain a subtle, almost imperceptible stillness, reminiscent of a [[Dustlings]]' glide. 

### Effects
	Increase DEX or CHA score by 1, to a maximum of 20
	You have advantage on **Stealth** checks made to hide in dusty, cluttered, or dimly lit enviroments
	You gain resistance to psychic damage from effects that cause confusion, memory loss, or fear
	You can cast *feather fall* as a reaction when you or a creature within 60ft of you falls. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficeny bonus per long rest. CHA is your spellcasting ablitiy for this spell
	The Veils influence makes you subtly unsettling to those unfamiliar with it's ways. You have **disadvantage** on Persuasion checks when interacting with creatures who have never been to the Veil
