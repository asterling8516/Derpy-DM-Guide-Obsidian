## **Astral Focus: The Whispering Star-Gem**

Celeste's ability to exist and interact with creatures on the Material Plane, and even across other planes, is facilitated by her **Astral Focus**, a powerful artifact known as **The Whispering Star-Gem**.

- **Appearance:** It is a palm-sized, perfectly smooth, multifaceted gem that seems to hold a swirling nebula of deep blues and silvers within its core. When active, it emits a faint, high-pitched hum, almost like a distant lullaby, and tiny motes of light drift from its surface.

- **Function:** The Star-Gem acts as an anchor, allowing Celeste's ethereal Fey form to coalesce and maintain stability in denser planes like the Material Plane. It channels and amplifies her connection to wishes and life-giving magic, making her interventions possible. Without it, her presence on such planes would be fleeting, translucent, and unable to interact physically.

- **Significance:** It is a direct conduit to her power and her very essence. If it were lost or damaged, her ability to manifest outside [[The Azure Bloom]] would be impossible.
