### **Lady Celeste, AKA The Blue Fairy**

## **Description:** 
Lady Celeste is an Arch Fey of who rules over [[The Azure Bloom]], renowned for her radiant presence and her profound connection to wishes and the spark of life. Celeste embodies the vibrant, remembered aspects of mortals – the joy of creation, the magic of dreams made real, and the enduring power of hope. She typically appears as a being of luminous, shifting blues and silvers, her form often coalescing from shimmering light, adorned with subtle, intricate patterns that evoke starlight and flowing water. Her voice is like wind chimes, and her touch can awaken dormant potential. She is compassionate and believes strongly in the inherent goodness of mortals, often intervening to guide or inspire. 

## **The "Pinocchio" Claim to Fame:** 
Celeste's most famous act, the one that cemented her legend and brought her immense adoration, was indeed the granting of a wish that brought a wooden puppet, **Pinocchio**, to life. This act was a dazzling display of pure, unadulterated Fey magic – a direct infusion of life and soul into an inanimate object, driven by the pure wish of a lonely woodcarver. The sheer wonder and widespread _remembering_ of this miracle amplified Celeste's power and fame within the Fey Wilds and echoed even into the Material Plane. This power granted her a demi plane of her own known as [[The Azure Bloom]]
