**The Static Aurora:** A visually stunning but confusing phenomenon. The sky fills with a silent, crackling static of shifting colors. This "static" is the residual energy of the planar collision, and it interferes with magic. During a Static Aurora, spellcasters might find their spells behaving unpredictably, with effects being weaker, stronger, or changing entirely. Itâ€™s a physical manifestation of the lingering discord of [[The Great Cataclysm]].
