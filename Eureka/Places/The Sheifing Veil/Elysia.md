Home to [[Lady Seraphina]] made of things like old discarded books, old broken potion bottles, some of the fancier more refined housing looks to be make from the yellowing paper. Large stones have been pressed into the ground making cobble stone pathways. Standing tall in the four cardinal directions are massive lamps. some seem to be ran on gas others using some form of magic that were casting the glow that you were able to see so far away. Standing in the center of the city is a tower that stretches up into the dust clouds. Small floating creatures wander the streets known as [[Dustlings]]. Farms dot the landscape around the city growing various [[Mushrooms]] and mold.
