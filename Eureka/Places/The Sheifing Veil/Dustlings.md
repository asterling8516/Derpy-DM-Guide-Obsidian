The most striking inhabitants are theÂ **Dustlings**, small, roughly humanoid fey creatures that flit across the muted plains. These tiny beings are living embodiments of forgotten lint and neglected corners, their bodies comprised of soft, fuzzy dust and shimmering fibers. They possess large, intricate wings, often resembling delicate moth or dried leaf structures, that beat with a soft, almost inaudible hum, allowing them to dart and glide through the air. Their faces are often obscured by wisps of dust or tattered scraps of cloth, with only their small, glowing eyes piercing the gloom. With delicate, twig-like limbs, they are serene, silent creatures, often seen collecting motes of lost dreams and unfulfilled wishes that float in [[The Shifting Veil|the Veil]]'s atmosphere, or tending to the forgotten trinkets that litter the landscape. They are the quiet, watchful caretakers of [[The Shifting Veil|the Veil]]'s forgotten treasures.
