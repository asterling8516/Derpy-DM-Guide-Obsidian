The Shifting Veil is the last destination of all forgotten things. That sock you lost, the sweater your grandma gave you but you secretly hated, those potion bottles from the healing potions you drank while fighting the dragon, that memory that sits on the tip of your tongue that you can't quite recall. The Shifting Veil lays claim to them all! 

The landscape of The Shifting Veil is a curious tapestry woven from the detritus of lost thought and discarded reality. It feels strangely contained, almost like a vast, dust-filled attic. Mountains might rise as colossal, forgotten buttons, their smooth, cool surfaces reflecting the dim, hazy light. Valleys could be formed from the deep creases of a crumpled, unread letter, or the folds of a discarded map. Pathways might be paved with countless, identical bottle caps, or stretch across the flattened remains of a forgotten board game.

The Shifting Veil is a place of quiet contemplation, where the echoes of what was are far more tangible than the fleeting present, and every forgotten thing finds its final, peaceful resting place.

## Creatures
The Shifting Veil is home to many oddities. The odd small fairy like creatures called [[Dustlings]], the larger [[Tumblesteeds]] that seem to have there fur harvested and consume small motes of light that manifest around them. 

## Flora
While the sun is always high in the sky here its constantly blurred into a dusk-like sky and the constant coating of dust causes most plants to wither and die here. But strands of [[Mushrooms]] and moss have been cultivated here by the [[Dustlings]]
