Lady Seraphina is an arch fey who resides in a demi plane accessible through liminal spaces. The places behind dressers and where all your missing socks go to when they disappear. Her lands are made of forgotten creatures that have been lost to time as they fell into her demiplane. Her demiplane reaches across all planes and all worlds wherever you find a liminal space you can find Lady Seraphina. She believes it is her duty to protect the liminal beings and all those who find their way to her. She is typically a pacifist, but will definitely stand her ground to defend those who live or have been to her demi plane. She longs for the day that she too will be able to leave her plane and experience the outside world, but for that to happen she will need to find someone who is able to remember her and help others remember her as her curse it to be forgotten just like all those missing socks.
