## Description

The **Veil Steeds** are magnificent, yet strangely ephemeral, creatures of [[The Shifting Veil]]. Their bodies are colossal, tangled spheres of soft, silvery-gray dust and forgotten fibers, resembling immense, living dust bunnies. From this voluminous form extend surprisingly long, slender, and almost twig-like legs, allowing them to traverse the hazy plains with an eerie grace. Despite their considerable size, they possess delicate, almost translucent wings, no larger than a bee's, that beat with a soft, inaudible hum, allowing them to drift silently rather than gallop.

Veil Steeds are serene and docile, often found grazing on the ethereal motes of lost dreams and forgotten thoughts that drift through [[The Shifting Veil|the Veil]]'s atmosphere. Their immense, yet lightweight forms, combined with their silent, gliding movement, make them ideal for pulling carriages through the unpredictable terrain of the demiplane, offering a unique and almost dreamlike mode of transport for those who understand their gentle nature. They are often seen in small herds, a silent procession across the muted landscape.

[[Dustlings]] harvest their fur for various magical clothes depending on the type of fur gathered. From clothes that produce a soft glow to more armor like clothing.
