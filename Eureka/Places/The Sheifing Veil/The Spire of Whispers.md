The Spire of Whispers is not so much a castle as it is a breathtaking, tragic testament to [[Lady Seraphina]]'s existence. It is an impossible structure, a single, towering monument that spirals upward into the hazy, dust-filled sky of The Shifting Veil, visible from any point in her domain. Its construction is a mosaic of colossal, forgotten things: walls are formed from the brittle, yellowed pages of books no one finished; grand archways are made from the bent, impossibly large frames of eyeglasses that no one ever looked through; and its foundation rests on a mountain of countless, unpaired socks, their colors muted and their textures worn by time.

The palace's interior is a labyrinth of quiet, echoing halls. The air within is filled with a constant, low murmurâ€”the collective whispers of lost stories, unfinished thoughts, and the fleeting, forgotten memories of the denizens of the Veil. There are no grand windows, but light filters in through the translucent, dust-coated fabrics of forgotten curtains and shrouds that drape from the high ceilings. At the very heart of the Spire lies Seraphina's throne room, a place of stark, beautiful simplicity where the only adornment is the endless, glittering cascade of the Veil's dust, which falls in a silent, continuous curtain behind her throne. It is a place of profound melancholy and unshakeable authority, a monument to the power and the pain of being forgotten.
