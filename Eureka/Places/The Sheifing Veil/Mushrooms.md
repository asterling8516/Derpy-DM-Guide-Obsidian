Due to the strange nature of [[The Shifting Veil]] most vegetation cannot grow here. Though the [[Dustlings]] seem to have found a way to cultivate mushrooms that seem to have been affected by the Veil and have taken new forms. 

## Glimmercaps
Tiny mushrooms that have caps that glow with a very soft silvery light. When eaten a creature must succeed a **WIS saving throw** or take a -1 to all mental stats for the next hour. On a success the creature has a sense of clarity and gains advantage on saving throws against being confused for the next hour

## Echo Bells
These mushrooms have strange caps that resemble small delicate bells made of muted gray fabric. These mushrooms chime with a faint sound of a bell when disturbed. When a creature eats one they have a moment of vivid, though often sad, nostalgia and make a **WIS saving throw** on a fail they are distracted (stunned) for a round. When a creature passes they gain advantage on their next d20 roll. 

## Hallow Stalks
These mushrooms have hallow, brittle stalks that crumble into dust when consumed though are surprisingly filling. When eaten a creature makes a **WIS saving throw** is stunned for 5min on a fail. On a pass you gain advantage on intelligence checks and gain the ability to understand and speak any language you see or hear. 

## Tear-Blossoms 
These mushrooms often grow in clusters. They "weep" a clear salty liquid. When eaten they provide a profound sense of relief, as if a great weight has been lifted from your shoulders. Make a **CON saving throw** on a fail take **4d6 psychic damage** on a pass remove one level of exhaustion or end one condition affecting you (at the DM's discretion).

## Threadweavers
These mushrooms appear to be made out of random patches of fabric stitched together. When eaten they give you a sense of what may come next. The creature makes a **WIS saving throw** on a fail take **3d6 physic damage**. On a pass for the next hour you can reroll a attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make, you must take the new roll. 

## Unseen Umbrellas
These are large flat topped mushrooms that are translucent making them hard to find in nature as they are easily overlooked. When eaten they are extremely filling and give you a strange sense of contentment.  The creature gains 5 temp hp, and have advantage on being charmed for the next hour.
