This city sits as one as one of the kingdom of hearts prominent port cities. Once upon a time the city was going to be the capital, but creatures from the surrounding waters were a constant threat so the capital was moved to what would later be called [[Infernium - The Capital City|Infernium]] the city was almost abandoned by the time they were able to tame the waters. Mistveil has since grown becoming a hub for airships and sailing ships. Massive towers with cranes stretch into the sky  allowing for easy cargo transportation working along side the cranes are massive devils that can be seen loading and unloading cargo. The city is made up stone based buildings with wooden upper floors. The surrounding ocean covers the city in a constant mist giving an almost eerie feeling to new comers visiting for the first time. 

Just as the city was about to be fully abandoned the waters surrounding Mistveil were tamed
