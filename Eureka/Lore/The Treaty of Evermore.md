# The Great War
Once the four planes collided, the peoples of the planes **immediately** blamed each other for **what became known as** The Great Cataclysm and began fighting for dominance of the new world. The war lasted for over a century and cost many lives. Much of the world's history was lost, **leading** to the birth of new religions. **The constant arguing over who was to blame for the Cataclysm also** caused much misinformation to be recorded.

Eventually, the leaders of the four planes came together and signed **the** Treaty of Evermore. This caused the formation of the four Kingdoms we know today: **Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, and Clubs**. The four kingdoms began rebuilding and pushed the world into an industrial age **fueled by** magic, creating new forms of transportation and new machines.

# The Treaty
The Treaty of Evermore was signed in hopes of stopping the war and allowing for a new world to be made, though no one expected what came next. After **two centuries** of peace, the people of the planes began to intermingle, and the four kingdoms became mixed. This allowed for great growth as **knowledge, customs, magic, and technology were freely shared amongst them**.

There were those who hated this transference of people and believed it to be an omen for bad things to come. However, **most** loved this era, as the world saw great progression.

With the help of the **Demons and Fiends of the Nine Hells** and the wit and whimsy of the **Fae Wilds**, the contract that was signed is believed to be unbreakable. Yet, there are those on all sides who believe that specific wording was used to ensure it **could be broken**... when the time is right.
