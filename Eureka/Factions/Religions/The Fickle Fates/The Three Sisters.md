### Description
This boomerang is a ranged weapon carved from blue dragon scales and combined with an electrum core. When thrown, it has a range of 60/120 feet, and any creature that is proficient with the javelin is also proficient with this weapon. On a hit, the boomerang deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage and 3d4 thunder damage, and the target must succeed on a DC (10+**your proficiency bonus**) Constitution saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of its next turn. On a crit fail attack throw the boomerang dose not return to the creatures hand. 

Once the boomerang deals thunder damage to a target, the weapon loses its ability to deal thunder damage and its ability to stun a target. These properties return after short rest or the thrower can use a spell slot to charge the boomerang. Adding higher level spell slots do not add any bonus damage. 

The boomerang is a ranged weapon, and any creature proficient with the javelin is also proficient with this weapon.

On a miss, a boomerang returns to the thrower's hand.
