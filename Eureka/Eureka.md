# Eureka
A world filled with magics from the inner planes. Where fairytales come to life!

## Where did we come from?
The story of Eureka begins as any good fairy tale does. Once upon a time long long ago in a land far far away, there was a Sorcerer who sought knowledge and the power to defeat his enemies. Well one day the sorcerer was given a book and upon reading it was overwhelmed with great power he cracked the barrier between the four planes. 

**Shadowfell, The Nine Hells, The Fae Wilds, and The Material Planes.** Asmodeus saw this as his opportunity to lay claim to the four planes and fully broke the barrier between worlds. This caused the planes to collide creating one giant new plane of existence. This act of pure chaos would later come to be known as The Great Cataclysm.

## The War
After [[The Great Cataclysm]] all sides blamed each other for the cataclysm and began fighting to gain control in this new world. Many lives were lost on all sides until a treaty was enacted to save the last remaining lives. [[The treaty of Evermore]], was put in place to protect all the new inhabitants of the lands from further bloodshed and give each plane time to rebuild and repopulate. 

## Peace
Peace has lasted for 500 years since the signing of [[The Treaty of Evermore]]. Each plane took a part of Eureka to call its own choosing to inhabit whatever remained of the plane they originated from. Over time the people began to mix and mingle as did the magics and rules of the other planes. This gave rise to new species and magics.
