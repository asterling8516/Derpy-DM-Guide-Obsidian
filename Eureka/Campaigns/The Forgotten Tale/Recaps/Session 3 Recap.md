The party did this mostly, but here's some key points:

- Everyone woke up in a tavern after having dreamed of the travels to [[Mistveil Anchorage|Mistveil]]. 
- You all have terrible migraines
- There were two more beds in this room than there were members in your party. 
- You asked the Inn Keep Sora. A small Tiefling woman about the beds and asked how many of you had come. She told you only the 4 of you that she knew about. 
- You learned people around town had talked about people who have gone missing, but most thought they were crazy or playing jokes
- You found the missing archive that was disguised as a normal house.
- When you went inside you found a small library with tombs from floor to ceiling and a small door painted over to look like a normal bookshelf
- After picking the lock you found a small room with blood leading to small window out the back.
