So last time you headed out into the obsidian maw the boiling seas that surround the kingdom of hearts and more importantly Mistveil. You were sailing out with Captain Jedidiah Ahab to kill the great White Whale Moby Dick. During your trip you encountered a massive creature who's gaping mouth created a whirlpool trying to pull you in. Stove was able to stop the approaching tentacles and you all were able to escape the maelstrom after convincing Sleepy not to launch himself out of a cannon. After that you were able to find a massive white island that Captain Ahab  said was "the beast himself" you moved the ship into range and open fired with the cannons. Moby charged the ship and Stove was able to hold him in place for a few rounds while you were able to dwindle down his health. He managed to break free doing massive damage to your ship almost causing it to sink, but you were just barely able to kill Moby and save the ship. 

And that is where we are now.
