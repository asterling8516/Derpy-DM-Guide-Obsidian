’Twas the night after battle, and all through the boat, You worked through the pain just to keep it afloat. Captain Ahab had promised rewards for the fight, But peace wasn't destined to last through the night.

The deck gave a tremble, the waters went wild, Then fell deadly silent, no longer so mild. From the depths rose a figure, with skin caramel, **Ursula** rose with a treacherous yell.

**Adamson** knew her, and watched with a start, As she wept for the Whale with a heavy, cold heart. The tethers all snapped as she lifted the beast, Proclaiming that mortals would now be the feast.

"I'll kill you!" screamed Ahab, with rage in his eye, But she twisted her wrist and she reached for the sky. The manta rays changed into monsters of dread, Then off toward **Infernium** the elementals sped.

A wave crashed aboard with a terrible sweep, And sent you all drifting to magical sleep. Then visions took hold in the astral expanse, While gods and machines did a dangerous dance.

Adamson met with the Tree of All Life, While **Sleepy** and **Odin** saw Fates amidst strife. And **Stove** met a man with a massive machine, Who kept planes from crashing—a fatherly scene?

"The gods are all dying," they said with a sigh, "Because of a deal with a dragon on high. So you have been chosen to take up the throne, If you live long enough to ascend on your own."

They reassured you that you were not dead, Then sent you back home to the bodies you shed. But before you awoke, they bestowed you a **Boon**, To aid in the battles that would happen soon.

You woke on the wreck, with the crew nowhere found, With smoke on the horizon and silence all round. To **Mistveil** you trekked, but the Captain was gone, Just gifts in his house, and a town all withdrawn.

The migraines returned and the people looked grey, As memory and hope seemed to wither away. More folks had gone missing, erased from the mind, With only a trail of dark blood left behind.

To the **Shop of Many Things** for a chaotic prize, Then **Happily Ever After**—with fear in their eyes. For Sleepy, it seems, gave the merchant a scare, So he waited outside in the cool evening air.

You opened your items to see what they hold, Then followed the blood trail, courageous and bold. Toward the **Obsidian Cathedral**’s dark gate, **To see what new nightmares and horrors await.**
