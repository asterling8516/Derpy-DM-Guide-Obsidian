# Who
a "book golem" named **Codex**

# What
Head to [[Mistveil Anchorage]] and figure out what has happened to the library there. Codex has been unable to reach them for a while and has sent parties before you to try and find out what has happened to them. Though none of them have returned. Each time a group never returned he has sent larger and larger parties hoping to get some word as to what has happened.

# Reward
 100,000 GP
 The Horn of Valhalla (already received)
