Last time we started our adventure with the four of you having found yourself in a place of forgotten things with a strange metal pylon. A strange tower. You were greeted with a projection of a message from "yourselves" telling you that your job is find the first chord and in order to be sent to this place the memories of you had to be removed in order to have been forgotten and get here. Those memories you now hold in Echo Shards on your person. A warning was given that the memories you hold are all the memories you and everyone else has of you and to do what you must with them. You were also greated with a mechanical owl whom Garp tried to sneak up on and looked in his bag. He was caught and stared at with his hand in the owls bag. Garp and Nyja flew up into the sky and found some light polution off in the distance and the group decied to head there, but not before Fynn thought to lay on the instant tower and say the command word causing almost causing his death. Instead he lost half his movement speed until a long rest after which Garp hog tied Fynn to the flying broom and you took off. After traveling for a full day you finally decieded to settle down for the night and found a bunch of items. A wand, some smelly chests, and some cool stones with which you then made a dustman top hat and all. You all rested....and that where we are now.
