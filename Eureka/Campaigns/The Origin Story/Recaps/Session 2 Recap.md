Last time our group continued on there journey through the forgotten lands. Meeting a person who was half normal half shrunken with gray skin small wirey wings. Nigjya approached the creature and it repeatedly asked her if she knew who she was or where she is. They repeatedly forgot the conversation and continued to ask the same set of questions. Kookush, cast identify on the creature and learned that something was causing the creature to change through transmutation magic. The thought occurred to you that whatever is happening to this person possibly is happening to a couple of us. You then were attacked one of the nights buy shadow wolves whose silent howls caused you to wake. Nyja's quick thinking cast hunger of hudar outside the front door to keep the beasts away. The owl trying to assist began giving out temp hp and blessing you. Garp thinking you were all just being loud rolled back over and tried to go back to bed until he too was struck by the massive headache. He woke and began shooting his pistols in kookoshes ear using his shoulder to stabalize his guns. Fyn misty stepped from the tower out to the clearing and cast lightning killing off the remaining enemies. Unfortunatly the storm that was raging outside caused his magic to backlash and he struck himself as well. You then finished your rest realizing that tomorrow you would reach your destination.
