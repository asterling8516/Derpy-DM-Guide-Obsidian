’Twas a moment of rest, and all through the zone, The party was tired, and felt quite alone. The egg was passed round with a sigh and a shrug, "It’s dead," you all thought, giving one final tug.

When out on the ground there arose such a clatter, A whistle blew loud to see what was the matter! To the entrance you flew like a flash in the night, To see devils soaring in unholy flight.

Then Jersey, he gasped, and his face turned to stone, For **Zalost** was there, on a time-twisted throne. "The Second-Hand King!" Jersey cried with a shout, "Who tortured my father and tore his soul out!"

You rested up long, to prepare for the fray, But the rope-bound raptor decided to play! It snapped at the restraints, ready to bite, But Jersey made quick work and ended the fight.

Then off to the Crystal Ruins you flew, To set up a trap for the devilish crew. But the earth gave a rumble, a terrible sound, As pyramids rose, bursting out of the ground! The market was crushed in the blink of an eye, While dust and debris clouded up the dark sky.

"Quick, to the boulder!" the party did call, You hung it up high, waiting for it to fall. You waited for hours, in shadows you lay, But the devils stayed put, refusing to play.

So **Garp** took his gun, with an eye sharp and hot, And severed the rope with a single crack shot! _CRASH_ went the rock, sealing the door, "I guess," said the party, "they won't use that no more."

Then **Fynn** dug through rubble, with holiday cheer, Thinking, _"Maybe there's something to help us out here?"_ He sifted through trash with a scavenger's roar, And pulled out a **Vorpal Sword** from the floor!

Up the great pyramid, the party did creep, Past rotten food-stuffs and secrets held deep. In a kennel abandoned, a treasure remained, A cloak of **Elven Chain**, slightly blood-stained. To **Nijya** it went, a gift for the flight, Who flew down the hall to investigate the light.

But down in the darkness, waiting in chains, Were devils specifically bred for your pains! Nijya cast _Hunger_, a cold, biting space, While the rest of you charged all over the place!

The fists, how they flew! The spells, how they flashed! Against metal links, the party all crashed. But Jersey, poor Jersey, his punches flew wide, He swung and he missed, with nowhere to hide. With a crack and a thud, the Monk hit the floor, And Jersey, unconscious, could battle no more.

The last devil fell, silence claimed the hall, With Jersey knocked out, and backs to the wall. You survived the encounter, though bruised and beat, but the clock is still ticking...and skipping a beat.
